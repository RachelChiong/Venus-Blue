Key performance indicators (KPIs) are metrics that are used to proxy for performance.

### 1. Lines Changed per Day

The number of lines changed per day in the repository is a key performance indicator since it directly correlates to the amount of work being done with the code base. As more functionality and changes are made, the closer the project comes to completion and success. This is true in general, but this metric can fail to correctly correlate changes with corresponding productivity. Highly technical changes and high-quality work produce less code for a high amount of productivity. Furthermore, this KPI may capture changes that are not directly productivity-related.

### 2. Team Messages per Day

In a highly productive and collaborative environment, a team must communicate effectively to enable different components of the system to be integrated. Therefore, productivity can be proxied by the amount of communication within the team. Our choice of communication is over a messaging system, and hence the number of messages can be used as a KPI. This metric may not be valid when team messages are not related to the project.

### 3. Bug Detection Rate

The number of bugs detected and fixed is a good KPI for code development, but requires more nuanced interpretation since a variety of factors can affect the metric meaning it does not correlate directly with productivity. For example, a high bug detection rate may be considered bad if the code is poorly implemented, or good if there is high code coverage during testing.

### 4. Code Refactoring

The amount of code refactoring correlates with productivity by measuring the efficiency of code implementation. If less refactoring is done then the better the first-pass code implementation. Some refactoring may always be required with code reviews, but too much code refactoring leads to time loss for other project tasks. The amount of code refactoring can be measured by identification in team communication and code reviews.

### 5. Task Completion Time Overshoot

The amount of time dedicated to a task after the allocated period highly correlates to performance. If a task is completed early after it was predicted to take longer, this can imply that the person was productive in getting the task done. On the other hand, this KPI can suffer from the inability to accurately predict the required time allocation for tasks.
